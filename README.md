 # Using MPI to Parallelize an All-Pairs Problem
 
 ## 1. The Problem Description
 
  You are given a table T consisting of two attributes, x and y. The table is stored as n tuples of x and y in a file. The values inside a tuple are separated by a tab character; each tuple ends with a new line character (therefore a tuple is a line).

Based on a given file, you are asked to write an MPI program to calculate the distance of each pair of (x,y), and then find the top 5 shortest distances and their corresponding pairs.

## 2. Explain how to compile and run the program

- How to compile:

```c
$ make
```

- How to run:

```c
$ make qtest
```

- Play with different core quntity: (the core number you wnat to run)

```c
CORE_N := 2
```

- Play with different data scale
  - modify `data number` in the `main.c` program
  - modify main.c `freope`n path to `test.txt`
  - modify `input_gem.c`’s `data number`: `n`
  - >$ make thtest

- Monitor time cost
  - default is open, you can close it by cancel macro `TIMETEST`

## 3. Describes how you parallelize the computations
 
1. Process 0 give n (x, y) to other worker process.
2. Every process calculate (n / worker process quntity) quntity point with other points distance.
3. Worker processes return five shortest distances to process 0.
4. Process 0 use stack five the smallest distances in all return distances.

## 4. Scalability

10000 data scale, 100 times statistics:
